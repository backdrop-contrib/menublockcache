Menu Block Cache
======================

This project adds a setting to menu blocks that enable them to be cached.

If all links in a menu are always visible to all users, this can be a great way
to boost the performance of your site.  Please note that this should not be
used in conjunction with any content access modules, or you may risk caching and
exposting sensitive information to people who are not intended to see it.

Installation
------------

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules

- Configure any menu block on any layout under Administration > Structure >
  Layouts (admin/structure/layouts) and check the box to cache the menu.
